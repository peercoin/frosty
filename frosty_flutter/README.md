# Frosty for Flutter

This plugin allows `frosty` to be used on flutter apps without needing to
prebuild the libraries. Linux, Android, macOS, and iOS platforms are supported.
Windows may also work but hasn't been tested.

The `FrostyLoader` widget is also provided that ensures that the library has
loaded before use.
